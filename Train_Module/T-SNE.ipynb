Pertanto, anche se non vedi gruppi distinti, ciò non significa necessariamente che non ci siano pattern più sottili.\n","   - Inoltre, t-SNE ha parametri chiave (come la perplexità e il tasso di apprendimento) che possono influenzare significativamente la visualizzazione. Sperimentare con questi parametri potrebbe rivelare strutture diverse nei dati.\n","\n","In conclusione, il grafico suggerisce che, almeno nello spazio t-SNE, l'anno non sembra essere un forte discriminante per questi dati. Tuttavia, per una comprensione più approfondita, potresti esplorare ulteriormente con diversi parametri di t-SNE, o potresti esaminare i dati utilizzando altre tecniche di analisi o visualizzazione per vedere se esistono altre tendenze o pattern."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DF6Otbh48yyo"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"machine_shape":"hm","name":"","provenance":[{"file_id":"13sspqiEZwso4NYTbsflpPyNFaVAAxUgr","timestamp":1706182618564},{"file_id":"1RU2D0OfUp9vkpPnZGN1pSUrVtf_HcvPz","timestamp":1672185517864},{"file_id":"1TAAi_szMfWqRfHVfjGSqnGVLr_ztzUM9","timestamp":1670007363628},{"file_id":"1rY7Ln6rEE1pOlfSHCYOVaqt8OvDO35J0","timestamp":1623440015685},{"file_id":"1XTKHiIcvyL5nuldx0HSL_dUa8yopzy_Y","timestamp":1568928635382},{"file_id":"1gUnPS2zuUOUe4YG-2iDm_Y2X5RTkgsGh","timestamp":1556293046020}],"version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
